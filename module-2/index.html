        What is AutoCad? <br> &diams;  AutoCAD is a computer-aided design (CAD) software developed by Autodesk. It's widely used across various industries for creating 2D and 3D designs, drafting, modeling, and architectural plans. <br>
        &diams; AutoCAD provides a graphical user interface (GUI) where users can interact with various tools and functionalities. <br> 
        &diams; AutoCAD offers a wide range of drawing tools such as lines, circles, arcs, rectangles, polygons, and splines. These tools allow users to create precise geometric shapes and structures. <br>
        &diams; Editing Tools used: Editing tools in AutoCAD enable users to modify existing geometry. This includes commands like move, copy, rotate, scale, mirror, trim, extend, fillet, and chamfer.
        <br><br><i><u>Here we have used Fusion-360 software to create our job!</i></u>
    <div class="text">
        Fusion 360 is a powerful computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided engineering (CAE), and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) software developed by Autodesk. It is a cloud-based platform that integrates design, engineering, and manufacturing processes into a single environment, allowing users to create, simulate, and fabricate their designs efficiently. <br>

<i>Here's some key information about Fusion 36 -</i>
&diams; Fusion 360 offers a comprehensive set of features for 3D modeling, parametric modeling, sculpting, simulation, rendering, animation, and CAM toolpath generation. It provides tools for mechanical design, industrial design, product development, and more. Fusion 360 also includes collaboration tools that enable teams to work together on projects in real-time. <br>
&diams; Parametric Modeling: Fusion 360 utilizes a parametric modeling approach, allowing users to create designs with customizable parameters and easily make design changes at any stage of the process. This flexibility is particularly useful for iterative design and engineering workflows. <br>
&diams; Cloud-Based: Fusion 360 is a cloud-based software, which means that designs are stored and accessed online. This allows for seamless collaboration among team members, as well as access to design files from anywhere with an internet connection. Additionally, cloud computing resources are utilized for tasks such as rendering and simulation, enabling faster processing times. <br>
&diams; Integration: Fusion 360 integrates CAD, CAM, and CAE functionalities into a single platform, streamlining the product development workflow. Users can move seamlessly between designing, simulating, and manufacturing their products without the need for multiple software applications or file conversions. <br>
&diams; Subscription Model: Fusion 360 is available on a subscription basis, with various pricing plans tailored to different user needs, including hobbyists, students, startups, and professionals. Autodesk offers free licenses for students, educators, and startups meeting certain criteria, making Fusion 360 accessible to a wide range of users. <br>
&diams; Community and Support: Fusion 360 has a large and active user community, with forums, tutorials, and online resources available to help users learn the software and troubleshoot issues. Additionally, Autodesk provides customer support through various channels, including online help documentation, tutorials, and direct customer support. <br>
