            &diams; LASER cutting is a technology that utilizes a high-powered laser to cut materials with precision. <br> 
            &diams; Laser cutting works by directing the output of a high-powered laser, typically through optics, onto the material to be cut. <br> &diams; The laser beam melts, burns, or vaporizes the material along the predetermined path, leaving a clean, precise edge. <br>
            &diams; Laser cutting is widely used in manufacturing, fabrication, and various industries for cutting intricate shapes, patterns, or designs. Common applications include cutting parts for machinery, signage, jewelry, electronic components, architectural models, and custom fabrications. <br>
            &diams; Laser cutting offers high precision and accuracy, allowing for intricate designs and tight tolerances. It can be used on a wide range of materials and thicknesses. <br>
            &diams;  Laser cutting involves the use of high-powered lasers, so safety precautions are essential to prevent eye injuries, skin burns, and fires. Proper ventilation and extraction systems are also necessary, especially when cutting materials that produce toxic fumes.

                <i><u>The working of LASER Cuttind machine -</i></u>
                Laser cutting works by directing a focused laser beam onto the surface of the material, which heats, melts, or vaporizes the material along the desired cutting path. The laser beam is typically controlled by a computer numerical control (CNC) system, allowing for precise control of the cutting process.

            <h2>Here we have drawn the basic structure of cycle creating a continuous loop through out. Due to it's continuous loop the tracing of the cycle is appropriate. Then in the LASER Cutting machine we imported the file and then set the power, speed and the appropriate cutting area . After setting this we also fixed the origin and then also fixed the box in which the cycle was to be cut down. Hence on turning the LASER button on we are ready to cut our cycle. Lastly we just turned on the start option and the LASER cutting process started. </h2>
